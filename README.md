# Referral_based_competition_and_Advertisement_website 

This website is built using python flask and Mongodb. This website is for the advertisement of a product, 
The idea is to build a simple competition webpage within the clientâ€™s website that encourages people to spread the news about the new product.
Users arrive at the page and sign up a form. After a successful sign up, they get one entry for the competition. 
At that point, they also have an option to share the sign-up link. Every successful sign up referred via the link will give extra competition entries to the original link poster.
There is no limit to the number of entries that a person can have. So, the idea is: The more entries you have, the higher your chance to win the prize.
